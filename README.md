## Welcome to Act1!

The project is written using React Native. The main libraries we use:

- [React Native Firebase](https://rnfirebase.io/) helps us interact with Firebase.
- [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/README.html) ensures we have a single source of truth.
- [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started) will take us to the right place.
- [restyle](https://github.com/Shopify/restyle) provides a theming toolkit and a supercharged `Box` (View) & `Text` components.

### Installation

- Fork the repo and clone to your machine.
- Run `yarn install`
- Run `cd ios && pod install`
- Create a firebase project and set it up on iOS & Android according to [React Native Firebase](https://rnfirebase.io/#2-android-setup) docs
- Clone our [cloud functions](https://github.com/act-1/cloud-functions) repo, install it and run the emulator (more info at the repo)
